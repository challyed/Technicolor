# Technicolor
##Introduction
When Silicon Valley released their reports on race percentages in tech companies, I challenged myself to come up with as many African-American lead tech startups as could (without using Wikipedia) and I came up with none.  However, I was able to come up with black singers, actors, criminals, authors,  talk show host, and Neil Degrasse Tyson. I tried to come up with any Hispanic lead ones and came up with none. (and so on) I was conflicted Race has nothing to do with having the right skills in the leviathan monster that we call tech jobs or become a tech leader.
